// File readers:

int getc(FILE *stream)
/* given a working FILE *stream, reads and returns a character, or EOF (-1)
progresses the counter for which character is read, meaning subsequent calls 
*/ read new characters as long as they remain to be read

size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
/* 
ptr: buffer for file contents
size: size of a member (sizeof(char) as an example)
nmemb: number of members
stream: file pointer
*/
